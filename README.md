# Internet Graveyard
Internet Graveyard is the place where the dead websites rest

A Twitter bot will work as a gravedigger, every one hour it will find a webpage that had been somewhere online but no longer accessible (aka, a webpage that is dead), and make a grave for it with it's digital fingerprint.

All the graves it makes will be displayed on a website, the Internet Graveyard.
